Haskell type classes in Ruby.

Concept
-------

The main goals of this project is to create statically typed subset of Ruby
inside dynamically typed Ruby programs as a set of functions which know
types of it's arguments. There is something like function decorator
which checks if function is correctly typed after it is defined.
Type declarations are needed for typeclass definition only. All other types
are known due to type inference, so the code looks like normal Ruby code.

Of course there is a runtime overhead due to the use of type classes.
Therefore another important goal is an optimiaztion which is possible
because of the known types. It can be performed with bytecode generation
at runtime. In this way the bytecode generated by Ruby interpreter
will be replaced with the optimized code generated directly from the source.
If the optimized bytecode can not be generated due to some reasons
(no back end for the virtual machine, for example), the code can be
interpreted in the usual way because it is still a normal Ruby code.
